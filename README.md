### This is Ayid's first git project!

This short project just demonstrated how to use Git to manage and track my project folders.
- set up a remote repository on GitHub and then copy it onto local machine.
- Once this repo is set up locally, we will be able to use Git like a save button for our files and folders.
- When we have finalized our saves, we can then push our local repo up onto GitHub to share with everyone!
